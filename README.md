---

> 1. Implement the insertion inside iterative and recursive Binary search tree and comparetheir performance.

> 2. Implement divide and conquer based merge sort and quick sort algorithms and compare their performance for the same set of elements.

> 3. Compare the performance of Strassen method of matrix multiplication with traditional way of matrix multiplication.

> 4. Implement the activity selection problem to get a clear understanding of greedy approach.

> 5. Get a detailed insight of dynamic programming approach by the implementation of Matrix Chain Multiplication problem and see the impact of parenthesis positioning on time requirements for matrix multiplication.

> 6. Compare the performance of Dijkstra and Bellman ford algorithm for the single source shortest path problem.

> 7. Through 0/1 Knapsack problem, analyze the greedy and dynamic programming approach for the same dataset.

> 8.Implement the sum of subset.

> 9. Compare the Backtracking and Branch & Bound Approach by the implementation of 0/1 Knapsack problem. Also compare the performance with dynamic programming approach.

> 10. Compare the performance of Rabin-Karp, Knuth-Morris-Pratt and naive stringmatching algorithms.
