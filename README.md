This repository contains implementations of various algorithms completed as part of our lab exercises. Each lab focuses on a different algorithmic concept, including recursive and iterative approaches, divide and conquer, and greedy strategies. Below is a brief description of each lab:

## **_LAB-1: Binary Search Tree Insertion_** üå≥
### Topic: 
Implement the insertion inside iterative and recursive Binary Search Tree (BST) and compare their performance.

- **Description**: This lab demonstrates the implementation of both iterative and recursive approaches to inserting elements into a Binary Search Tree. The performance comparison highlights the differences between these two methods.

## **_LAB-2: Merge Sort and Quick Sort_** üîÑ
### Topic:
Implement divide and conquer-based Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms and compare their performance for the same set of elements.

- **Description**: This lab focuses on two important sorting algorithms: Merge Sort and Quick Sort. By implementing both, we compare their performance when applied to the same dataset.

## **_LAB-3: Matrix Multiplication_** ‚ûï‚ûó
### Topic:
Compare the performance of Strassen's method of matrix multiplication with the traditional way of matrix multiplication.

- **Description**: In this lab, we explore matrix multiplication using Strassen's method and the traditional method, comparing their efficiency for different matrix sizes.

## **_LAB-4: Activity Selection Problem_** üéØ
### Topic:
Implement the activity selection problem to get a clear understanding of the greedy approach.

- **Description**: The activity selection problem is implemented to showcase the greedy algorithm approach, which helps in selecting the maximum number of activities without overlapping.

## **_LAB-5: Matrix Chain Multiplication_** üî¢
### **Topic:**
*Get a detailed insight into dynamic programming by implementing the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem and exploring the impact of parenthesis placement on time requirements.*

- **Description**: This lab introduces *dynamic programming* to optimize the computation time in matrix multiplication by adjusting the placement of parentheses. It demonstrates the effect of matrix ordering on the performance of multiplication.

## **_LAB-6: Shortest Path Algorithms_** üö¶
### **Topic:**
*Compare the performance of Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms for the single-source shortest path problem.*

- **Description**: This experiment covers two essential algorithms for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph: **Dijkstra's** (*greedy approach*) and **Bellman-Ford** (*dynamic programming approach*). The comparison provides insights into their efficiency and best-use scenarios.

## **_LAB-7: 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Greedy vs Dynamic Programming_** üéí
### **Topic:**
*Through the 0/1 Knapsack problem, analyze both greedy and dynamic programming approaches using the same dataset.*

- **Description**: In this lab, we implement the 0/1 Knapsack problem with both *greedy* and *dynamic programming* techniques. The performance comparison highlights the trade-offs in **accuracy** and **efficiency** between these approaches.

## **_LAB-8: Subset Sum Problem_** üßÆ
### **Topic:**
*Implement the subset sum problem to explore decision-making for finding subsets within a target sum.*

- **Description**: This lab focuses on the *subset sum problem*, an important decision-making problem where subsets of elements are selected to achieve a specified sum. The lab illustrates **recursive** solutions and **dynamic programming** approaches for optimization.

## **_LAB-9: 0/1 Knapsack - Backtracking vs Branch & Bound_** üîó
### **Topic:**
*Compare the Backtracking and Branch & Bound approaches for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem, alongside a comparison with dynamic programming.*

- **Description**: This lab explores three techniques for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem: **Backtracking**, **Branch & Bound**, and **dynamic programming**. The comparison helps illustrate the scenarios where each approach is more efficient or effective.

## **_LAB-10: String Matching Algorithms_** üîç
### **Topic:**
*Compare the performance of Rabin-Karp, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and naive string-matching algorithms.*

- **Description**: In this lab, three string-matching algorithms are implemented: **Rabin-Karp**, **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**, and the *naive approach*. The comparison of these algorithms provides insights into their **time complexity** and practical **use cases** for pattern matching.
